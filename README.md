 Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project



 The purpose and background
 the purpose of this assignment was to find out how campaigns did when considering their launch date or their funding goals for Louise. Excel was used to show campaign outcomes depending on their launch date and was used Show the percentage of successful, failed, and cancelled plays depending on the funding goal amount.

## Analysis and Challenges

 )
 
According to the graph above based on the data collected in each month there seemed to be more successful outcomes than failed or canceled. The most successful month being May over 100 which then took a sharp decline to 60, and the least would be December (less than 40)  which seems to have the least amount of goals. The amount of failed outcome is more than the cancelled with the least amount of failed being in the months of March September and November all under 40   and the most in October. Lastly there were not many canceled theater projects in fact in the month of October there were no cancelled projects and the most calced which was in January was under 10.



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
 
According to the graph above the goals that were less than 1000 were the most successful and had the least failures with the percentages being about 80%, 20 % respectfully. As the goal rises the percent of successful outcomes fall at 25000 t0 29999 80% of outcomes are failed and 20% are successful. On between The 35000-40000 goals there are more successful (>60%) goals than failed(>40%) however Goals have a higher percentage of failures 100%,>80% And lower successful percentage 0%,<20%.The graph seemed to depicted no cancelations .

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
there seemed to be more successful outcomes than failed or canceled outcomes and the more successful outcome where within the summer months.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most of the higher goals have the least number of successful outcomes. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The dataset was large so a general with many rows an issue I faced was focusing on extracting the information that was needed. Which after  


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could possibly see which categories or subcategories where more successful
