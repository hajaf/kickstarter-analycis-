According to the graph above based on the data collected in each month there seemed to be more successful outcomes than failed or canceled. The most successful month being May over 100 which then took a sharp decline to 60, and the least would be December (less than 40)  which seems to have the least amount of goals. The amount of failed outcome is more than the cancelled with the least amount of failed being in the months of March September and November all under 40   and the most in October. Lastly there were not many canceled theater projects in fact in the month of October there were no cancelled projects and the most calced which was in January was under 10.

According to the graph above the goals that were less than 1000 were the most successful and had the least failures with the percentages being about 80%, 20 % respectfully. As the goal rises the percent of successful outcomes fall at 25000 t0 29999 80% of outcomes are failed and 20% are successful. On between The 35000-40000 goals there are more successful (>60%) goals than failed(>40%) however Goals have a higher percentage of failures 100%,>80% And lower successful percentage 0%,<20%.The graph seemed to depicted no cancelations .

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

there seemed to be more successful outcomes than failed or canceled outcomes and the more successful outcome where within the summer months for the analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date.Most of the higher goals have the least number of successful outcomes in the analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals. 
The dataset was large  with many rows an issue I faced was focusing on extracting the information that was needed which after taking my time to really look at the data provied its self to be a minor problem. We could possibly see which categories or subcategories where more successful. we could also find out which countries had the mest suceful plays all in the form of a bar chart
